*Lab2: Scheduler

This discrete event simulator schedules various processes with different arrive time, total CPU time, CPU/IO bursts. It computes and outputs finish time, turnaround time, IO time, and CPU waiting time.
It also summerizes finishing time of last event, CPU/IO utilization, average turnaround/waiting time, and throughput.

It supports scheduling algorithms including: FCFS, LCFS, SRTF, RR (RoundRobin), PRIO (PriorityScheduler) and PREemptive PRIO (PREPRIO).

Compile with makefile. See details in spec.
